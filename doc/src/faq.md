### Can rustup download the Rust source code?

The source for Rust's standard library can be obtained by running `rustup
component add rust-src`. It will be downloaded to the `<toolchain
root>/lib/rustlib/src/rust` directory of the current toolchain.

The source for the compiler and tools must be obtained from the [Rust
repository] or the standalone [source tarballs].

### rustup fails with Windows error 32

If `rustup` fails with Windows error 32, it may be due to antivirus scanning
in the background. Disable antivirus scanner and try again.

### I get "error: could not remove 'rustup-bin' file: 'C:\Users\USER\\.cargo\bin\rustup.exe'"

If `rustup` fails to self-update in this way it's usually because RLS is
running (your editor is open and running RLS). The solution is to stop RLS (by
closing your editor) and try again.

### rustup exited successfully but I can't run `rustc --version`

To get started you need Cargo's bin directory (`$CARGO_HOME/bin`) in your
`PATH` environment variable. This should be done by rustup. Next time you log
in this should have been done automatically.
