*rustup* installs [The Rust Programming Language] from the official
release channels, enabling you to easily switch between stable, beta,
and nightly compilers and keep them updated. It makes cross-compiling
simpler with binary builds of the standard library for common platforms.
And it runs on all platforms Rust supports, including Windows.

## Installation

Follow the instructions at [www.rustup.rs](https://www.rustup.rs). If
that doesn't work for you there are [other installation
methods](#other-installation-methods).

`rustup` installs `rustc`, `cargo`, `rustup` and other standard tools
to Cargo's `bin` directory. On Unix it is located at
`$HOME/.cargo/bin` and on Windows at `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin`. This
is the same directory that `cargo install` will install Rust programs
and Cargo plugins.

This directory will be in your `$PATH` environment variable, which
means you can run them from the shell without further
configuration. Open a *new* shell and type the following:

```
rustc --version
```

If you see something like `rustc 1.7.0 (a5d1e7a59 2016-02-29)` then
you are ready to Rust. If you decide Rust isn't your thing, you can
completely remove it from your system by running `rustup self
uninstall`.

#### Enable tab completion for Bash, Fish, or Zsh

`rustup` now supports generating completion scripts for Bash, Fish,
and Zsh. See `rustup help completions` for full details, but the
gist is as simple as using one of the following:

```
# Bash
$ rustup completions bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/rustup.bash-completion

# Fish
$ rustup completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/rustup.fish

# Zsh
$ rustup completions zsh > ~/.zfunc/_rustup
```

*Note:* you may need to restart your shell in order for the changes to take affect.

*Note:* For Zsh, see additional details below

#### Addtional Notes for Zsh

One can alternatively copy [`src/rustup-cli/zsh/_rustup`](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs/blob/master/src/rustup-cli/zsh/_rustup) into a directory, e.g. `~/.zfunc/`.

Regardless of method, you must then add the following line in your `~/.zshrc` before `compinit`:

```zsh
fpath+=~/.zfunc
```

## How rustup works

`rustup` is a *toolchain multiplexer*. It installs and manages many
Rust toolchains and presents them all through a single set of tools
installed to `~/.cargo/bin`. The `rustc` and `cargo` installed to
`~/.cargo/bin` are *proxies* that delegate to the real
toolchain. `rustup` then provides mechanisms to easily change the
active toolchain by reconfiguring the behavior of the proxies.

So when `rustup` is first installed running `rustc` will run the proxy
in `$HOME/.cargo/bin/rustc`, which in turn will run the stable
compiler. If you later *change the default toolchain* to nightly with
`rustup default nightly`, then that same proxy will run the `nightly`
compiler instead.

This is similar to Ruby's [rbenv], Python's [pyenv], or Node's [nvm].

[pyenv]: https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv
[nvm]: https://github.com/creationix/nvm

## Keeping Rust up to date

Rust is distributed on three different [release channels]: stable,
beta, and nightly. `rustup` is configured to use the stable channel by
default, which represents the latest release of Rust,
and is released every six weeks.

[release channels]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0507-release-channels.md

When a new version of Rust is released, you can type `rustup update` to update
to it:

```
$ rustup update
info: syncing channel updates for 'stable'
info: downloading component 'rustc'
info: downloading component 'rust-std'
info: downloading component 'rust-docs'
info: downloading component 'cargo'
info: installing component 'rustc'
info: installing component 'rust-std'
info: installing component 'rust-docs'
info: installing component 'cargo'
info: checking for self-updates
info: downloading self-updates

  stable updated: rustc 1.7.0 (a5d1e7a59 2016-02-29)

```

This is the essence of `rustup`.

### Keeping rustup up to date

Running `rustup update` also checks for updates to `rustup` and automatically
installs the latest version. To manually check for updates and install the
latest version of `rustup` without updating installed toolchains type `rustup
self update`:

```
$ rustup self update
info: checking for self-updates
info: downloading self-updates
```

## Working with nightly Rust

Rustup gives you easy access to the nightly compiler and its
[experimental features]. To add it just run `rustup install
nightly`:

[experimental features]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/nightly-rust.html

```
$ rustup install nightly
info: syncing channel updates for 'nightly'
info: downloading toolchain manifest
info: downloading component 'rustc'
info: downloading component 'rust-std'
info: downloading component 'rust-docs'
info: downloading component 'cargo'
info: installing component 'rustc'
info: installing component 'rust-std'
info: installing component 'rust-docs'
info: installing component 'cargo'

  nightly installed: rustc 1.9.0-nightly (02310fd31 2016-03-19)

```

Now Rust nightly is installed, but not activated. To test it out you
can run a command from the nightly toolchain like

```
$ rustup run nightly rustc --version
rustc 1.9.0-nightly (02310fd31 2016-03-19)
```

But more likely you want to use it for a while. To switch to nightly
globally, change the default with `rustup default nightly`:

```
$ rustup default nightly
info: using existing install for 'nightly'
info: default toolchain set to 'nightly'

  nightly unchanged: rustc 1.9.0-nightly (02310fd31 2016-03-19)

```

Now any time you run `cargo` or `rustc` you will be running the
nightly compiler.

With nightly installed any time you run `rustup update`, the nightly channel
will be updated in addition to stable:

```
$ rustup update
info: syncing channel updates for 'stable'
info: syncing channel updates for 'nightly'
info: checking for self-updates
info: downloading self-updates

   stable unchanged: rustc 1.7.0 (a5d1e7a59 2016-02-29)
  nightly unchanged: rustc 1.9.0-nightly (02310fd31 2016-03-19)

```

## Directory overrides

Directories can be assigned their own Rust toolchain with
`rustup override`. When a directory has an override then
any time `rustc` or `cargo` is run inside that directory,
or one of its child directories, the override toolchain
will be invoked.

To pin to a specific nightly:

```
rustup override set nightly-2014-12-18
```

Or a specific stable release:

```
rustup override set 1.0.0
```

To see the active toolchain use `rustup show`. To remove the override
and use the default toolchain again, `rustup override unset`.

## Toolchain specification

Many `rustup` commands deal with *toolchains*, a single installation
of the Rust compiler. `rustup` supports multiple types of
toolchains. The most basic track the official release channels:
'stable', 'beta' and 'nightly'; but `rustup` can also install
toolchains from the official archives, for alternate host platforms,
and from local builds.

Standard release channel toolchain names have the following form:

```
<channel>[-<date>][-<host>]

<channel>       = stable|beta|nightly|<version>
<date>          = YYYY-MM-DD
<host>          = <target-triple>
```

'channel' is either a named release channel or an explicit version
number, such as "1.8.0". Channel names can be optionally appended with
an archive date, as in 'nightly-2014-12-18', in which case the
toolchain is downloaded from the archive for that date.

Finally, the host may be specified as a target triple. This is most
useful for installing a 32-bit compiler on a 64-bit platform, or for
installing the [MSVC-based toolchain] on Windows. For example:

```
$ rustup install stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

For convenience, elements of the target triple that are omitted will be
inferred, so the above could be written:

```
$ rustup install stable-msvc
```

Toolchain names that don't name a channel instead can be used to name
[custom toolchains].

[MSVC-based toolchain]: https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html#win-foot
[custom toolchains]: #working-with-custom-toolchains

## Cross-compilation

Rust [supports a great number of platforms][p]. For many of these
platforms The Rust Project publishes binary releases of the standard
library, and for some the full compiler. `rustup` gives easy access
to all of them.

[p]: http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/getting-started.html#platform-support

When you first install a toolchain, `rustup` installs only the
standard library for your *host* platform - that is, the architecture
and operating system you are presently running. To compile to other
platforms you must install other *target* platforms. This is done
with the `rustup target add` command. For example, to add the
Android target:

```
$ rustup target add arm-linux-androideabi
info: downloading component 'rust-std' for 'arm-linux-androideabi'
info: installing component 'rust-std' for 'arm-linux-androideabi'
```

With the `arm-linux-androideabi` target installed you can then build
for Android with Cargo by passing the `--target` flag, as in `cargo
build --target=arm-linux-androideabi`.

Note that `rustup target add` only installs the Rust standard library
for a given target. There are typically other tools necessary to
cross-compile, particularly a linker. For example, to cross compile
to Android the [Android NDK] must be installed. In the future, `rustup`
will provide assistance installing the NDK components as well.

[Android NDK]: https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html

To see a list of available targets, `rustup target list`. To remove a
previously-added target, `rustup target remove`.

## Working with Rust on Windows

`rustup` works the same on Windows as it does on Unix, but there are
some special considerations for Rust developers on Windows. As
[mentioned on the Rust download page][d], there are two [ABIs] in use
on Windows: the native (MSVC) ABI used by [Visual Studio], and the GNU
ABI used by the [GCC toolchain]. Which version of Rust you need depends
largely on what C/C++ libraries you want to interoperate with: for
interop with software produced by Visual Studio use the MSVC build of
Rust; for interop with GNU software built using the [MinGW/MSYS2
toolchain] use the GNU build.

When target the MSVC ABI, Rust additionally require an [installation
of Visual Studio 2013 (or later) or the Visual C++ Build Tools
2015][vs] so rustc can use its linker. For Visual Studio, make sure to
check the "C++ tools" option. No additional software installation is
necessary for basic use of the GNU build.

By default rustup on Windows configures Rust to target the 32-bit GNU
ABI, that is the `i686-pc-windows-gnu` target triple. More
specifically, the toolchains that rustup chooses to install, unless
told otherwise through the [toolchain specification], will be compiled
to run on a `i686-pc-windows-gnu` host, and will target that platform
by default. When you write `rustup update nightly`, rustup interprets
it as `rustup update nightly-i686-pc-windows-gnu`. You can change this
behavior with `rustup set default-host` or during installation.

```
$ rustup set default-host x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

[toolchain specification]: #toolchain-specification

Rust's support for the GNU ABI is more mature, and is recommended for
typical uses, so that's what `rustup` installs by default. The MSVC
toolchain is always available, even if you don't use it by
default. Just install it with `rustup install`:

```
$ rustup install stable-msvc
```

You don't need to switch toolchains to support all windows targets though;
a single toolchain supports all four x86 windows targets:

```
$ rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
$ rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
$ rustup target add i686-pc-windows-msvc
$ rustup target add i686-pc-windows-gnu # this one's installed by default
```

## Working with custom toolchains and local builds

For convenience of developers working on Rust itself, `rustup` can manage
local builds of the Rust toolchain. To teach `rustup` about your build,
run:

```
$ rustup toolchain link my-toolchain path/to/my/toolchain/sysroot
```

For example, on Ubuntu you might clone `rust-lang/rust` into `~/rust`, build it, and then run:

```
$ rustup toolchain link myrust ~/rustg/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/stage2/
$ rustup default myrust
```

Now you can name `my-toolchain` as any other `rustup`
toolchain. Create a `rustup` toolchain for each of your
`rust-lang/rust` workspaces and test them easily with `rustup run
my-toolchain rustc`.

Because the `rust-lang/rust` tree does not include Cargo, *when `cargo`
is invoked for a custom toolchain and it is not available, `rustup`
will attempt to use `cargo` from one of the release channels*,
preferring 'nightly', then 'beta' or 'stable'.

## Working with HTTP proxies

Enterprise networks often don't have direct outside HTTP access, but enforce
the use of HTTP proxies. If you're on such a network, you can request that
rustup uses a proxy by setting its URL in the environment. In most cases,
setting `http_proxy` should be sufficient. On a Unix-like system with a
shell like __bash__ or __zsh__, you could use:

```
export http_proxy=http://proxy.example.com:8080
```

On Windows, the command would be:

```
set http_proxy=http://proxy.example.com:8080
```

If you need a more complex setup, rustup supports the convention used by
the __curl__ program, documented in the ENVIRONMENT section of
[its manual page][curlman].

## Examples


Command | Description
--- | ---
`rustup default nightly` | Set the default toolchain to the latest nightly
`rustup target list` | List all available targets for the active toolchain
`rustup target add arm-linux-androideabi` | Install the Android target
`rustup target remove arm-linux-androideabi` | Remove the Android target
`rustup run nightly rustc foo.rs` | Run the nightly regardless of the active toolchain
`rustc +nightly foo.rs` | Shorthand way to run a nightly compiler
`rustup run nightly bash` | Run a shell configured for the nightly compiler
`rustup default stable-msvc` | On Windows, use the MSVC toolchain instead of GNU

`rustup toolchain link my-toolchain "C:\RustInstallation"` | Install a custom toolchain by symlinking an existing installation
`rustup show` | Show which toolchain will be used in the current directory

## Environment variables

- `RUSTUP_HOME` (default: `~/.multirust` or `%USERPROFILE%/.multirust`)
  Sets the root rustup folder, used for storing installed
  toolchains and configuration options. (rustup used to be called multirust. Use
  of `.multirust` is a holdover from that. See #537.)

- `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN` (default: none)
  If set, will override the toolchain used for all rust tool
  invocations. A toolchain with this name should be installed, or
  invocations will fail.

- `RUSTUP_DIST_SERVER` (default: `https://static.rust-lang.org`)
  Sets the root URL for downloading static resources related to Rust.
  You can change this to instead use a local mirror,
  or to test the binaries from the staging directory.

- `RUSTUP_DIST_ROOT` (default: `https://static.rust-lang.org/dist`)
  Deprecated. Use `RUSTUP_DIST_SERVER` instead.

- `RUSTUP_UPDATE_ROOT` (default `https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup`)
  Sets the root URL for downloading self-updates.

## Other installation methods

The primary installation method, as described at
[www.rustup.rs](https://www.rustup.rs), differs by platform:

* On Windows, download and run the [rustup-init.exe built for
  `i686-pc-windows-gnu` target][setup]. Despite being built against the GNU
  toolchain, _the Windows build of rustup will install Rust for the MSVC
  toolchain if it detects that MSVC is installed_. If you prefer to install GNU
  toolchains or x86_64 toolchains by default this can be modified at install
  time, either interactively or with the `--default-host` flag, or after
  installation via `rustup set default-host`. In general, this is the build
  of rustup one should install on Windows.
* On Unix, run `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh` in your
  shell. This downloads and runs [`rustup-init.sh`], which in turn
  downloads and runs the correct version of the `rustup-init`
  executable for your platform.

[setup]: https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/i686-pc-windows-gnu/rustup-init.exe
[`rustup-init.sh`]: https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/rustup-init.sh

`rustup-init` accepts arguments, which can be passed through
the shell script. Some examples:

```
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- --help
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- --no-modify-path
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- --default-toolchain nightly
```

If you prefer you can directly download `rustup-init` for the
platform of your choice:

<a name="vs2015">†</a>
MSVC builds of `rustup` additionally require an [installation of
Visual Studio 2015 or the Visual C++ Build Tools 2015][vs]. For
Visual Studio, make sure to check the "C++ tools" option. No
additional software installation is necessary for basic use of
the GNU build.

[vs]: https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads

To install from source just run `cargo run --release`. Note that
currently rustup only builds on nightly Rust, and that after
installation the rustup toolchains will supersede any pre-existing
toolchains by prepending `~/.cargo/bin` to the `PATH` environment
variable.

## Security

`rustup` is secure enough for the non-paranoid, but it [still needs
work][s]. `rustup` performs all downloads over HTTPS, but does not
yet validate signatures of downloads.

## FAQ

### Is this an official Rust project?

Yes. rustup is an official Rust project. Once it is complete it will
be the recommended way to install Rust and www.rust-lang.org will be
updated to reflect that.

### How is this related to multirust?

rustup is the successor to [multirust]. rustup began as multirust-rs,
a rewrite of multirust from shell script to Rust, by [Diggory Blake],
and is now maintained by The Rust Project.

### rustup fails with Windows error 32

If rustup fails with Windows error 32, it may be due to antivirus
scanning in the background. Disable antivirus scanner and try again.
