rustup-run 
Run a command with an environment configured for a given toolchain

USAGE:
    rustup run [FLAGS] <toolchain> <command>...

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
        --install    Install the requested toolchain if needed

ARGS:
    <toolchain>     Toolchain name, such as 'stable', 'nightly', or '1.8.0'. For more information see `rustup help
                    toolchain`
    <command>...    

DISCUSSION:
    Configures an environment to use the given toolchain and then runs
    the specified program. The command may be any program, not just
    rustc or cargo. This can be used for testing arbitrary toolchains
    without setting an override.

    Commands explicitly proxied by `rustup` (such as `rustc` and
    `cargo`) also have a shorthand for this available. The toolchain
    can be set by using `+toolchain` as the first argument. These are
    equivalent:

        $ cargo +nightly build

        $ rustup run nightly cargo build
