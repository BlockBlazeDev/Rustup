        Please read the following very carefully and decide if you
        actually need to file this bug...

        WSL, specifically WSL 1, has a limitation where glibc 2.31 and
        newer will panic, fundamentally the panic will look something
        like the following:

            thread 'main' panicked at 'assertion failed: `(left == right)`
              left: `22`,
             right: `4`', src/libstd/sys/unix/thread.rs:166:21

        This is a bug, but it's a bug in WSL, not in Rust/Rustup and will
        affect other programs built with Rust too.  Working around it
        with Rustup will not help you until WSL (or glibc) is fixed.

        This is known to affect:

          * Ubuntu 20.04
          * Arch Linux

        But it may affect other versions of Linux on WSL1.

        You can find more information on the WSL bug report
        [here](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4898).

        If you're CERTAIN that you're not reporting yet another duplicate
        of the above issue, then...

        **Thanks for filing a 🐛 bug report 😄!**
